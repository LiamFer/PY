# 9-6. Ice Cream Stand: An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. Write
# a class called IceCreamStand that inherits from the Restaurant class you wrote
# in Exercise 9-1 (page 166) or Exercise 9-4 (page 171). Either version of
# the class will work; just pick the one you like better. Add an attribute called
# flavors that stores a list of ice cream flavors. Write a method that displays
# these flavors. Create an instance of IceCreamStand, and call this method.
