# Integers
# You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python.

print( 5 + 4 )
print( 12 - 6 )
print( 30 * 5 )
print( 3 / 2)

# Python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents:

print ( 5 ** 3) # -> 5 * 5 * 5 = 125

# Python supports the order of operations:

print( ((7+3) * 4) / 2 ) 

# Floats -> Python calls any number with a decimal point a float.

print(0.2 + 0.1)

# Avoiding Type Errors with the str() Function

age = 19
print ("Happy " + str(age) + "rd Birthday!")


# 2-8. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
# operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations
# in print statements to see the results. You should create four lines that look
# like this: print(5 + 3)
# Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once
# on each line.

print ( 4 + 4 )
print ( 17 - 9 )
print ( (3 * 2) + 2 )
print ( 32 / 4)
print ( 2 ** 3)

# 2-9. Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using
# that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that
# message.

favorite_number = 19
print("My favorite number is " + str(favorite_number) + '!')
